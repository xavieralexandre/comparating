{"name":"Comparating","tagline":"Better rating through comparison","body":"# Comparating\r\n\r\nComparating is a project aimed at testing the practicability of rating things by comparing them by pairs.\r\n\r\nIt's a well-known idea ([Elo Rating System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), [Facemash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Facebook#Facebook.28facemash.29), [Polar](http://www.polarb.com)...) and I would like to try it on different use-cases to see if it is well suited to certain kind of activities.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I'm often confronted to the situation where a group of people want to agree on a choice.\r\nBe it which ice-cream flavors to buy, which user-stories to be completed in priority, which film to watch, or which restaurant where to eat.\r\n\r\n**A tool where you could choose or upload your set of things to rate, have everyone vote, and visualize the results to reach a consensus.**\r\n\r\n## [Try the Demo](comparating.meteor.com)\r\n\r\n_Coded by [Fran√ßois](http://about.me/francois.bruneau) (And a bit by [me](twitter.com/xavieralexandre)) as a pretext to dive into [Meteor](www.meteor.com)_","google":"UA-43461545-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
